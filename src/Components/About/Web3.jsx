                Polkadot will enable a completely decentralized web where users
                are in <br /> control.

                Polkadot is built to connect private and consortium chains,
                public and <br /> permissionless networks, oracles, and future
                technologies that are yet <br /> to be created. Polkadot
                facilitates an internet where independent <br /> blockchains can
                exchange information and transactions in a trustless <br /> way
                via the Polkadot relay chain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Polkadot makes it easier than ever to create and connect
                decentralized <br /> applications, services, and institutions.
                By empowering innovators to <br /> build better solutions, we
                seek to free society from its reliance on a <br /> broken web
                where its large institutions canâ€™t violate our trust.
